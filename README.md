# PizzaScheduler
A python script to create a schedule of pizzas to order for a party of ten every week
Ten people ranked different toppings and pizzas according to the following criteria:
0 - dislikes, 1 - tolerates, 2 - likes, 3 - favorite
This script comes up with three different pizzas every week while not repeating a pizza for three weeks and ensures that everyone will enjoy at least one pizza.
